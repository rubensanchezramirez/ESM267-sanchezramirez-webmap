# Brazil North and North East, Marine Extractive Reserves

### Ruben Sanchez Ramirez

Brazil has a network of marine extractive reserves (RESEX), a form of marine protected area (MPA) using comanagement. The RESEX program aims to bring traditionally marginalized populations with natural resource dependent livelihoods into national development processes by empowering them to participate in governance and steward biodiversity conservation. This map focuses on a group of coastal and marine RESEXs in the Northern and North Eastern regions of Brazil.

The jurisdictions of these RESEXs many times overlap with one or several municipalities districts. The map below displays the North and North East administrative regions, the States within those regions, the districts within the states, and the RESEXs themselves. These RESEXs have struggled to shift towards comanagement over the last 20 years amidst national level political changes in natural resource management policy and local level changes in fisher migration and increased harvesting.

[MER-GENTE](https://mergente-wwf.weebly.com), a UCSB Bren Master's Group Project Team, is working closely with World Wildlife Fund Brazil (WWF) and the Brazilian government to strategize ways to improve fisheries co-management. With the growing need for new management framing and hands-on deliverables, MER-GENTE is utilizing the Social-Ecological Systems framework to build a comprehensive process guild. MER-GENTE hopes this guild will help RESEX managers improve on day-to-day decisions and high-level campaign strategies.
